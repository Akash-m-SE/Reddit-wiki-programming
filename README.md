# Computer Science Learning Resources (To get a Job in Tech)


Assuming you get to this place an year or atleast 6 months before you start your job search, the resources below will help you get a job regardless of your location/familiarity with computer science.

Disclaimer: This doesn't make you a brilliant computer scientist but an excellent bread winner.

## Learn a Language

Many people avoid learning Python because the availibility of libraries make it difficult to test your ability manipulate data structures, but regardless I am only including the 3 prominent languages here with short links to other 2 which are getting popular.

**Languages for DSA covered here**

-Python
-C++
-Java


You can look up the pros and cons of learning each with a quick google search of "Language 1" Vs "Language 2"

## DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

Now you have understood the syntax of your preferred language and need to hon your problem solving skills. Personal suggestion is to read up on Space & Time Complexity before you go on this adventure so you can learn to think on those lines from the very start itself. 

### Learning Big O Notation [To calculate Space & Time Complexity]
